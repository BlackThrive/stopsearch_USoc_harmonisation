# Understanding Society and Police Stop and Search Harmonisation

The goal of this project is to provide illustrative examples of the how we combined Understanding Society variables with police stop and search data (acquired using [**extractss**](https://github.com/BlackThrive/extractss)) to explore the relationship between the use of stop and search and young people's mental health. The scripts are for illustration purposes. Understanding Society data is not made available here because it is subject to End User Licence agreement that must be made via the UK Data Service ([https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/)).
